# Side-B

This will be a TUI for a vinyl record collection. This is very very early development

I am using this project to learn how to use golang and how to interface with an API

What am I using to make this?
- I would like to connect to the Discogs api in order to let you interact with your collection through this app
- I plan to use Bubble Tea and Lip Gloss for the TUI
- I am using a sqlite local database for storing the data
